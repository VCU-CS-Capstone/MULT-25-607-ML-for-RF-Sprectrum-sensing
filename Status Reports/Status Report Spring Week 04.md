## 1) Accomplishments this week

- Collected data from SDR (Software-Defined Radio) to be used in machine learning training.
- Preprocessed and organized the SDR data to ensure it is ready for model training.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week

- Begin adjusting model parameters to train on the new SDR data.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the modelâ€™s performance on the new dataset.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns

- Uncertainty about the effectiveness of the current model when trained on SDR data, as it may differ significantly from previous datasets used.
