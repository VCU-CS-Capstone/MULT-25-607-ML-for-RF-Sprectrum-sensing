## 1) Accomplishments this week

- The initial model was trained, but its performance is not as expected—it’s not performing well on the data.
- The front-end system is up and running smoothly, with the interface functioning as intended and ready for further integration.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week

- Focus on improving the model’s performance by adjusting hyperparameters and fine-tuning.
- Continue front-end development to ensure smooth user interaction and gather feedback for improvements.
- Begin exploring model architectures or other techniques to enhance results.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns

- The model’s accuracy and performance are lower than expected, possibly due to insufficient data or inappropriate model configurations.
- Some parts of the model may not generalize well to new data, which will require further tweaking.
- While the front-end is working, more backend optimizations and integrations are needed to ensure seamless overall performance.
