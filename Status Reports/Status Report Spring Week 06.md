### 1) **Accomplishments this week**

- The model was fixed and is now performing as expected, showing improved results after adjustments to hyperparameters and configurations.
- The front-end is fully integrated with the model, ensuring smooth interaction and data flow between the user interface and the back-end.

### 2) **Milestones to be completed next week**

- Continue monitoring model performance and fine-tune it further if necessary.
- Focus on improving the quality of the data to ensure even better training results in future iterations.
- Collect user feedback on the front-end to identify any usability improvements.

### 3) **Issues, problems, or concerns**

- While the model is now functioning well, there may still be minor optimization opportunities to improve its accuracy or speed.
- The need to continuously enhance data quality may take time and resources, which could delay further improvements to the model.
